# html5-soundboard
I reverse engineered a file that Perry Harlock made 10 years ago. 
This repo is basically just a .ZIP containing the assets and instructions for a webpage.
I was using Flash 8 Pro to make the soundboard at first, but then I binged some results for an HTML alternative. 
I got to use my skills in several challenging codebases and ultimately reached the finish line.
I don't want to do anything else with this file, but of course I am interested in others' sage advice.
